I wrote before about my first published game [Fireman Fred][1], how bad it was, and how fond of it I am. 

I started and mostly completed a re-write of Fred in Z80 assembly language for the spectrum, but progress was realy, really slow. Recently
I got thinking about how easy it might be to try re-writing Fred using a modern game engine, and progress has been really, really, rapid.

I chose the Godot game engine for my rewrite, some pretty strict limitations for colors and resolutions, and the result is:

About a week of effort, and of course, you can [play it online][2].


Hope you enjoy playing this, check back for future updates.
