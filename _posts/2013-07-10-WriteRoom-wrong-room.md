Recently I bought a copy of WriteRoom the "Distraction free editor" from the app store. It cost around Â£6 and promised like conjunctivitis.com to be a site for sore eyes (tip of the hat to Tim Vine couldn't resist stealing it).

But it suffers from a tiny, teeny pain in the backside fault: It renames all files it opens to .txt. I ask you what kind of a brain dead app does that?

So now I have a blog workflow that has the extra step of finding the markdown file I just edited and then rename the blasted thing with an `md` prefix. Grrrr.

I'll post this just as soon as I rename it.
