Wow, that took a while. 

A little over two years ago I started writing an iOS app for those poor buggers doomed to commute into London every day. Today I finally got [Tubulate](http://www.designedincroxleygreen.com "Visit Tubulate Web Page") approved and on the [AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/tubulate/id965526109?mt=8 "Open the app store to see the app").

Now I haven't done any promotion of Tubulate yet, not even among my social connections, so I was surprised when  Tubulate had three downloads on the first day. 

When I looked at _who_ downloaded it I got an even  bigger surprise. Two people from east Asia and one from Japan.  So there you go, three downloads of an App for the London Underground, not one from even vaguely the same continent as London. Boy! are they lost :-)

Now  I can  start the Apple (&#63743;) Watch integration... Â
