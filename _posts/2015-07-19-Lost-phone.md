Ok, not a biggie, I lost my phone (understatement alert). However that little apple device I have strapped to my wrist is missing the little red icon of loneliness:

So at least I lost it in the comfort of my own home. Now, off to the land-line to call it and track it down. Eek, not so fast, I’ve got the blasted ringer muted. Hmmm…

After a moment of genuine head scratching I remember that the apple watch has a function for this. Going to the glances view and selecting the left most glance you get the following preferences pane.

Tapping the ‘*locate my phone*’ button makes your phone sound a pinging noise. Hurrah! phone found (at the top of the laundry basket, where it was sitting in my jeans pocket).

Trying to find your phone in the dark? pressing the ‘*locate my phone*’ button and holding your finger down will make the led  on the iPhone’s back strobe. Very cool.

Now where did I put my glasses…
