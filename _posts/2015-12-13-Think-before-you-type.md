Don't take this too seriously but it made me chuckle.

I was just looking at the home page for the [X-Plane flight simulator][1] and under the section on what our customers are saying I came across this little pearl of wisdom.

>I’m speechless! There are absolutely  no words that 
can describe the beauty in X-Plane 10.  I’m an avid 
flight simmer and current student pilot.  
X-Plane 10 is the closest to reality that I’ve experienced.
- Kendal, from Texas

It's amazing just how many characters a speechless person can consume to say how words can't describe something. 

However the fact that: "X-Plane 10 is the closest to reality that I’ve experienced", begs two questions: Is Kendal in The Matrix? or has he ever tried just looking out of the window?

Although you can forgive him for the hyperbole as, well, it is rather sexy.
