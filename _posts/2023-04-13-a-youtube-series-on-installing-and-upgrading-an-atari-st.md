# A YouTube series

Recently I've been recording a series on YouTube where I take a stock Atari STFM, upgrade it and build it into a daily driver.

The beginning of the series is this video, where I take a screw driver and a soldering iron to my ST in an attempt to upgrade it from TOS 1.02 to 1.04. It worked, eventually...

Staring with that as the baseline I began installing software upgrades to improve performance and capabilities, by updating the VDI, GDOS, installing a new desktop and finally adding multitasking.

which resulted in a much faster, more attractive ST.

Then I moved on to quality of life improvements and adding a CLI to our system.

Thats all for now but more episodes incoming.
