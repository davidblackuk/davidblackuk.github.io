# Privacy Policy

Hi Everyone

Tubulate is a free app. It is not ad-supported and so we require very little information about you and all of it is optional.

## Location

When the Tubulate starts it will ask you for permission to access your location. You have three choices:

+ Deny access to your location
  + Tubulate will function, but with reduced capabilities (no finding your closest stations etc)
+ Allow once
  + All functionality works as well as possible for this application launch, you will be presented with the three choices the next time you launch the app
+ Always
  + Every time you use Tubulate it will be able to access your location.

In all cases if you give Tubulate access to your location it will not store or send that location to an external service.

Tubulate does not access your location in the background.

## Application insights / analytics

When Tubulate is installed from the app-store you will be asked if you want to send usage and crash reports to Apple.

If you opt to send crash reports and usage you will be helping the development of the app by allowing me to find and fix defects.

If you opt not to send crash reports and usage information, Tubulate will continue to work as normal.

### Finally

To reiterate, Tubulate only uses personal information in the app itself, no evil, we just want you to enjoy it.

David Black
