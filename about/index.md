About me
========

I'm a programmer / architect / UI designer / compulsive code monkey. My day-to-day work is carried out in a mix of C#, HTML and Javascript under ASP.NET. When I'm coding at home I add objective-c and swift to the mix because basically I'm a masochist!

I've been in the business for quite a while, the results of my first piece of commercial code is shown below.

Yes that's a Spectrum game from 1983! My hair is still black underneath, I just choose to dye it Ash-grey :-)
