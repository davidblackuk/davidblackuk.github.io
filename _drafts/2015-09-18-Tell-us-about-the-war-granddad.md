A long time ago in a galaxy far away (at least that’s for far away the 80s seem today) I bought my first ever computer the awesome Sinclair ZX-Spectrum. I started out wanting a Sinclair ZX-81 but it took me almost two years to save up the money.

With the absolute confidence of youth I started off not with *hello world*, but with a game. While I was saving for my computer I had been reading magazine articles and library books on programming, so I did know something about what I was trying. Just not enough; It was *slow* and *terrible*.

The conventional wisdom of the time was that to make a game you had to write it in assembly language (this was absolutely true). So I wrote my second game. Which was *fast* and *terrible*. It was also **published**.

## Meet: Fireman fred

My first published game was *Fireman Fred*, named in the way of all Spectrum games, with gratuitous alliteration. It was a total Manic miner rip off, just far, far worse.

You had to climb the ladders collect the people (and cats too) and take them to the ambulance. Once all the victims had been collected you got to go to the next level. 

I had shown Fireman Fred to the owner of a local record/games shop in Sunderland (I worked there part-time, I wasn't just showing off to random strangers) he kept the tape and showed it to a rep for Tynesoft Computer Software. They were desperate for almost anything to sell back then so they signed me up.

I think the deal was an advance of £1,000 on royalties of 50p a copy sold. Surprisingly Fred made money. Who'd of thunk.

Here he is in all his box art glory (and following the rules of the day when box art had nothing to do with the game itself).
