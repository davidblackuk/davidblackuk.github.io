# Intro

This is part three of a series covering my Omni 128HQ Desktop from [retro-radionics][1]. The Omni 128HQ is a modern Sinclair Spectrum recreation with many special features. So far in this series I have covered: [An overview / review of the Omni device][101] and [a guide to configuring the Omni via DIP switches][102].

In this post we head off into the unchartered waters of video output. which is, surprisingly, tricky.

No HDMI yet
Cheap converter = composite 
Mid price converter = excellent
Mention PSU adaptor wrong size
