# ROMs to the left of me, ROMs to the right, here I am

I recently dug my Amstrad CPC-1628 out of the attic and started getting to know it again. 

I used the CPC as a daily driver for my job as a games programmer and one of my most abiding memories of it was my heavy use of ROM based applications. 

When the CPC-464 was my main work machine, loading apps from tape was appallingly slow. Working with an assembler / editor loaded from a c-15 tape with game files stored on 10 other C-15 cassettes made me a very unhappy chappie. An external FD-1 disc drive when it finally released would help a lot, but still I wanted: 

<div class="dbImg  centeredImg" data-src="../memes/more-power.png" alt="MORE POWER" ></div>
<div class="dbCaption"> MORE POWER.</div>

Pre-internet, pre-google, I went to the only search engine I had: WH Smiths the news agent and I bought a copy of Amstrad action issue one. 

<div class="dbImg zoom50  centeredImg" data-src="cpc/amstrad-action-001.png" alt="MORE POWER" ></div>


Inside amstrad action issue one page 25 I found this advert:

<div class="dbImg  centeredImg" data-src="cpc/maxam-rom-advert.png" alt="MORE POWER" ></div>
<div class="dbCaption"> They're advertising heaven</div>

The cartridge approach didn't appeal to me as it was fairly obvious from the get go that I'd want more ROMs as time went by. So I kept digging and found the following add on page 93 of issue one.

<div class="dbImg  centeredImg" data-src="cpc/rom-box-advert.png" alt="MORE POWER" ></div>
<div class="dbCaption">A sideways ROM advert from Honeysoft</div>

Honestly you won't believe the amount of time I spent thumbing through the PDFs of Amstrad Action when researching this. Maximum power?, Maximum nostalgia more like it.

Back on track and back in the past. Obviously I'm hooked on getting these, lets tally up what I'm spending here

|--|--|
|item                                  | price  |
|-------------------------------------:|:-------|
| 4 socket sideways ROM expansion card | £18.95 |
| ARNOR MAXAM Assembler                | £39.95 |
| **total**                            | £58.90 |

At this time I was using a green screen CPC-464 (with a MP-1 TV adaptor for color testing). That £58.90 represented a significant investment for me, 30% of the purchase price of the CPC. But I was a PRO and this was going to make me faster.

To be fair, it did.


## More ROMs

As my needs changed I added more and more ROMS to the mix.

|---|---|
|ROM|Description|
|---|---|
| Utopia  | A somewhat esoteric collection of utilities for extending BASIC, handling discs, tapes and ROMS.  |
| Parados | An AMSDOS replacement / upgrade that supports an number of different floppy disk formats included double sided discs on external drived.  |
| Protext  | A word processor  |
| Prospell  | A generic spell checker which was also integrated with Protext   |

At some point a new ROM box was required as I exceeded the limit of 4 ROMs, I can't remember which one I used, it was a kit from Everyday Electronics magazine (assembly required). 

The running total now is

## Wrap up

This concludes my description of the capabilities of my ROM box, whats in it, and what it does. Hope it's been of help. I'm following up this article with a detailed description of each of the ROMs that are in the box and I'll tweet when each article is published.
