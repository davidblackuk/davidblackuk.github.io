# Welcome to Utopia

Utopia is a ROM for the CPC range of computers, published by Arnor. 

The dictionary defines Utopia as

> a place of ideal perfection especially in laws, government, and social conditions

the operative expression here being: "*Ideal perfection*". Arnor defined the Utopia ROM as

> a collection of useful commands relating to many aspects of Amstrad
computing.

Bit of an impedance miss-match there. I think Arnor's crack marketing team might have gone a little over the top. I think the marketing team was also the documentation team and the programming team, AKA Brian Watson. So we'll give him plenty of leeway, he's a good guy that released most of Arnor's work as Virtual public domain when Arnor closed.

## What does it do?

Utopia provides a grab bag of commands for disc manipulation, file manipulation, extending Amstrad BASIC and more. The strength of Utopia didn't come from standalone use (though it does have great features), but from when it is used within other Arnor ROMS.

Take for example the `|LIST` command, which outputs a file on disc, to the screen (the equivalent of the Unix `cat` command). 

For general use in  BASIC  `|LIST` is a useful feature but from within MAXAM, the ROM based assembler, becomes vital. 

The MAXAM editor, edits one file at a time, `|LIST` prevents you from needing to save the current file and open multiple files to find where a sub-routine is defined. BASIC programmers didn't work with multiple files often, Assembly programmers did.
