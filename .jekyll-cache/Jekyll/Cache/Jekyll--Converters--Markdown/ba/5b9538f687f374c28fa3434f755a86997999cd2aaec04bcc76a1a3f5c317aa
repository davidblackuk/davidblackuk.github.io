I"±<p>Ok, not a biggie, I lost my phone (understatement alert). However that little apple device I have strapped to my wrist is missing the little red icon of loneliness:

<p>So at least I lost it in the comfort of my own home. Now, off to the land-line to call it and track it down. Eek, not so fast, Iâ€™ve got the blasted ringer muted. Hmmmâ€¦</p>

<p>After a moment of genuine head scratching I remember that the apple watch has a function for this. Going to the glances view and selecting the left most glance you get the following preferences pane.</p>

<p>Tapping the â€˜<em>locate my phone</em>â€™ button makes your phone sound a pinging noise. Hurrah! phone found (at the top of the laundry basket, where it was sitting in my jeans pocket).</p>

<p>Trying to find your phone in the dark? pressing the â€˜<em>locate my phone</em>â€™ button and holding your finger down will make the led  on the iPhoneâ€™s back strobe. Very cool.</p>

<p>Now where did I put my glassesâ€¦</p>
