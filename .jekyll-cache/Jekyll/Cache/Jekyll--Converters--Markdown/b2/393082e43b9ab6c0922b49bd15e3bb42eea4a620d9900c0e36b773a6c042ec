I"¸<p>I wrote before about my first published game <a href="/Tell-us-about-the-war-granddad/">Fireman Fred</a>, how bad it was, and how fond of it I am.</p>

<p>I started and mostly completed a re-write of Fred in Z80 assembly language for the spectrum, but progress was realy, really slow. Recently
I got thinking about how easy it might be to try re-writing Fred using a modern game engine, and progress has been really, really, rapid.</p>
