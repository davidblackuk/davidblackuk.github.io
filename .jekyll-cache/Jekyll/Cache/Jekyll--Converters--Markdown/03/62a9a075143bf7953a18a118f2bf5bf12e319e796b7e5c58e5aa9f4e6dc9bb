I"§<p>Recently I bought a copy of WriteRoom the â€œDistraction free editorâ€ from the app store. It cost around Â£6 and promised like conjunctivitis.com to be a site for sore eyes (tip of the hat to Tim Vine couldnâ€™t resist stealing it).</p>

<p>But it suffers from a tiny, teeny pain in the backside fault: It renames all files it opens to .txt. I ask you what kind of a brain dead app does that?</p>

<p>So now I have a blog workflow that has the extra step of finding the markdown file I just edited and then rename the blasted thing with an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">md</code> prefix. Grrrr.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll post this just as soon as I rename it.</p>
