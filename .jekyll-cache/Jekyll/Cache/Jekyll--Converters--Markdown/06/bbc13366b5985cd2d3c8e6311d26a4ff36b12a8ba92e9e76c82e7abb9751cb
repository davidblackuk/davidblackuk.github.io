I"Ó<p>Bit of a quick one this. So you have an OpenShift project and a domain name that you want to access it through, how do you proceed?</p>

<p>There is a small amount of work to be done both at the domain hosting end and the OpenShift application end. In my case I have the brand new domain:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.designedincroxleygreen.com" title="Go to the site via the new address">https://www.designedincroxleygreen.com</a></p>

<p>and I want it to point to the existing OpenShift application:</p>

<p><a href="http://tubular-davidblack.rhcloud.com" title="Access the site via the OpenShift hosted name">http://tubular-davidblack.rhcloud.com</a></p>

<h1 id="first-step-configure-dns">First step: Configure DNS</h1>

<p>At a minimum we need a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CNAME</code> DNS record to allow us to forward the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">www.designedincroxleygreen.com</code> address to OpenShift. If we wanted to do this at the base level and have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">designedincroxleygreen.com</code> resolve to our app weâ€™d need an A record and more effort.</p>

<p>While you domain registrars page will probably appear different to mine the approach is the same, go to the control panel and find the â€˜advancedâ€™ DNS settings page and add a new CNAME record pointing to your app. The DNS entry is for the pattern <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">www</code> and the remote item  is your OpenShift application URL.</p>

<h1 id="second-step-configure-openshift">Second step: Configure OpenShift</h1>

<p>Now weâ€™ve told the DNS servers where to route the domain to, we have to tell OpenShift to serve the application for that name. We do this using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rhc</code> tubular is the name of my application</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; rhc alias add tubular www.designedincroxleygreen.com
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will create a vhost in apache to route the requests for that domain to our app. To confirm the creation of the alias we can list out all aliases</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; rhc alias list tubular
Alias                          Has Certificate? Certificate Added
------------------------------ ---------------- -----------------
www.designedincroxleygreen.com no               -
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>My domain registrar says it can take up to 48 hours for changes to propagate. My bindings started working after about 28 hours. Your mileage may vary.</p>
