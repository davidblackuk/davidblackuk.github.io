I"*<p>Don’t take this too seriously but it made me chuckle.</p>

<p>I was just looking at the home page for the <a href="http://www.x-plane.com/desktop/home/">X-Plane flight simulator</a> and under the section on what our customers are saying I came across this little pearl of wisdom.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m speechless! There are absolutely  no words that 
can describe the beauty in X-Plane 10.  I’m an avid 
flight simmer and current student pilot.<br />
X-Plane 10 is the closest to reality that I’ve experienced.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Kendal, from Texas</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s amazing just how many characters a speechless person can consume to say how words can’t describe something.</p>

<p>However the fact that: “X-Plane 10 is the closest to reality that I’ve experienced”, begs two questions: Is Kendal in The Matrix? or has he ever tried just looking out of the window?</p>

<p>Although you can forgive him for the hyperbole as, well, it is rather sexy.</p>
